# Telomere-to-telomere consortium

## Introduction

We have sequenced the CHM13hTERT human cell line with a number of technologies, including 120x coverage of [Oxford Nanopore](https://nanoporetech.com), 70x [PacBio](https://www.pacb.com/) CLR, 30x [PacBio](https://www.pacb.com/) HiFi, 50x [10X Genomics](https://www.10xgenomics.com), as well as [BioNano DLS](https://bionanogenomics.com/technology/dls-technology/) and [Arima Genomics HiC](https://arimagenomics.com/kit/). Most raw data is available from this site, with the exception of the PacBio data which was generated by the University of Washington and is available from [NCBI SRA](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra?linkname=bioproject_sra_all&from_uid=269593).

Human genomic DNA was extracted from the cultured cell line. As the DNA is native, modified bases will be preserved. Nanopore sequencing was performed using Josh Quick's [ultra-long read (UL) protocol](https://www.protocols.io/view/ultra-long-read-sequencing-protocol-for-rad004-mrxc57n).

# Assembly releases
### v1.0
<a href="https://s3.amazonaws.com/nanopore-human-wgs/chm13/assemblies/chm13.draft_v1.0.fasta.gz">Complete T2T reconstruction of a human genome</a>, with the exception of 5 known gaps within the rDNA arrays. Polished assembly based on v0.9. Introduces 4 structural corrections and 993 small variant corrections, including a 4 kb telomere extension on chr18. Polishing was performed using a conservative custom pipeline based on DeepVariant calls and structural corrections were manually curated. Consensus quality exceeds Q60. Prior to a preprint being drafted, a brief summary can be found at this [blog post](https://genomeinformatics.github.io/CHM13v1/).

### v0.9
<a href="https://s3.amazonaws.com/nanopore-human-wgs/chm13/assemblies/chm13.draft_v0.9.fasta.gz">T2T reconstruction of all 23 chromosomes of CHM13</a> based on a custom assembly pipeline, briefly featuring:

1. Homopolymer-compression and self-correction of Pacbio HiFi reads
2. Rescoring of overlaps to account for recurrent Pacbio HiFi errors
3. Construction and custom pruning of a string graph built over 100% identical overlaps
4. Manual reconstruction on chromosomal paths through the graph, if necessary aided by ultra-long Nanopore reads
5. Layout/consensus of original HiFi reads, corresponding to the resulting paths
6. Patching of regions absent from HiFi data with v0.7 draft sequences

Consensus quality exceeds Q60. Mitochondrial sequence DNA included. Centers of the 5 rDNA arrays are represented by N-gaps.

### v0.7
<a href="https://s3.amazonaws.com/nanopore-human-wgs/chm13/assemblies/chm13.draft_v0.7.fasta.gz">Assembly draft v0.7</a> was generated with [Canu v1.7.1](https://github.com/marbl/canu) including rel1 data up to 2018/11/15 and incorporating the previously released PacBio data. Two gaps on the X plus the centromere were manually resolved. Contigs with low coverage support were split and the assembly was scaffolded with BioNano. The assembly was polished with two rounds of [nanopolish](https://github.com/jts/nanopolish) and two rounds of [arrow](https://github.com/PacificBiosciences/GenomicConsensus). The X polishing was done using unique markers matched between the assembly and the raw read data, the rest of the genome used traditional polishing. Finally, the assembly was polished with 10X Genomics data. We [validated](https://github.com/skoren/bacValidation) the assembly using [independent BACs](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nuccore/?term=VMRC59). The overall QV is estimated to be Q37 (Q42 in unique regions) and the assembly resolves over 80% of available CHM13 BACs (280/341). The assembly is 2.94 Gbp in size with 359 scaffolds (448 contigs) and an NG50 of 83 Mbp (70 Mbp). Outside of Chr8 and ChrX, this should be considered a draft and likely has mis-assemblies. Older unpolished assemblies are available for benchmarking purposes, but are of lower quality and should not be used for analyses.

# Sequencing Data

## Oxford Nanopore Data
We sequenced a total of 367 Gbp of data (118x coverage). The read N50 is 53 kbp and there are 193 Gbp bases in reads >50 kbp (62x). The longest full-length mapping read is 1.3 Mbp. Sequencing data was generated from three lines of CHM13 (NHGRI, UW, UCD), which all originate from the original line established by Urvashi Surti. Only the NHGRI line was karyotyped and confirmed to be stable prior to sequencing. For the NHGRI line, NHGRI (PI: Phillippy) and University of Nottingham (PI: Loose) contributed approximately 140 flowcells of UL data using Quick's ultra-long protocol; 199 Gbp (64x, 1.4 Gbp/flowcell). The read N50 is 71 kbp and there are 128 Gbp of data in reads >50 kbp (41x). For the UW line, University of Washington (PI: Eichler) contibuted 80 flowcells of UL data using a new UL protocol developed by Glennis Logsdon; 38 Gbp (12x, 0.5 Gbp/flowcell). The read N50 is 130 kbp and there are 30 Gbp of data in reads >50 kbp (10x). For the UCD line, UCDavis (PI: Dennis) contributed two PromethION cells using a ligation prep; 114 Gbp (37x, 57 Gbp/flowcell). The read N50 is 36 kbp and there are 25 Gbp of data in reads >50 kbp (8x).

## BioNano DLS Data

Approximately 430x of data was generated using the Saphyr instrument and the DLE-1 enzyme. There are 15.2 M molecules with an N50 molecule length of 115.9 kbp and a max of 2.3 Mbp (2 M molecules > 150 kbp, N50 218 kbp). The assembly of the molecules is 2.97 Gbp in size with 255 contigs and an NG50 of 59.6 Mbp.

## Previously generated PacBio data

The PacBio data (both CLR and HiFi) was previously generated and is available from the <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra?linkname=bioproject_sra_all&from_uid=269593">SRA</a>. The list of P6-C4 cells used for arrow polishing are listed <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nanopore-wgs-consortium/CHM13/master/pbP6Cells">here</a>.


# Notes on downloading files.

Files are generously hosted by Amazon Web Services. Although available as straight-forward HTTP links, download performance is improved by using the Amazon Web Services <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/cli/">command-line interface</a>. References should be amended to use the `s3://` addressing scheme, i.e. replace `https://s3.amazon.com/nanopore-human-wgs/` with `s3://nanopore-human-wgs` to download. For example, to download `CHM13_prep5_S13_L002_I1_001.fastq.gz` to the current working directory use the following command.

    aws s3 --no-sign-request cp s3://nanopore-human-wgs/chm13/10x/CHM13_prep5_S13_L002_I1_001.fastq.gz .

or to download the full dataset use the following command.

    aws s3 --no-sign-request sync s3://nanopore-human-wgs/chm13/ .

The s3 command can also be used to get information on the dataset, for example reporting the size of every file in human-readable format.

    aws s3 --no-sign-request ls --recursive --human-readable --summarize s3://nanopore-human-wgs/chm13/ 

or to obtain technology-specific sizes.

    aws s3 --no-sign-request ls --recursive --human-readable --summarize s3://nanopore-human-wgs/chm13/nanopore/fast5
    aws s3 --no-sign-request ls --recursive --human-readable --summarize s3://nanopore-human-wgs/chm13/nanopore/rel2
    aws s3 --no-sign-request ls --recursive --human-readable --summarize s3://nanopore-human-wgs/chm13/assemblies

Amending the `max_concurrent_requests` etc. settings as per <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/topic/s3-config.html">this guide</a> will improve download performance further.
